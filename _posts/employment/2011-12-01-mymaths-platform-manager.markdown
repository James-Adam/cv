Responsible for the MyMaths web service, the then largest online educational maths platform in the UK. This role developed from integration of what was a newly acquired business, hooking in back-office systems (SAP, CRM etc), recruiting, training and managing a new team of developers and project managers and then on to designing and implementing a complete rewrite of the system. At it's peak I managed a team of 9 full time programmers, as well a project manager whilst managing the development and day-to-day running of such a well established platform. MyMaths had around 5 million users, served over 9 million page views per week and was regularly in the top 500 Alexa charts(UK) whilst under my care.
