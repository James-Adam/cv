Following my successful management of the *rewrite of MyMaths* I was promoted to manage development of across *all of the Education Divisions web platforms*. This included continued support for the MyMaths web service - *internationalisation* and *global rollout* of the platform - and bringing development practices (SCM, TDD, CI) for two other major web applications. I continued the management of my previous team, whilst adding new support staff and extra developers (peaking at 7 full time staff). I also oversaw the *rollout of agile project management methodologies* through the supporting publishing and editorial teams - which **my team had pioneered** within the company.
