*Grasping the opportunity to join this impressive startup* spun out of Oxford University I joined as a Senior Developer right at beginning of the transition from prototype code to productionised service. Built on years of academic research DiffBlue aims to change the way developers test their code, and my role is to bring this to a straight forward, accessible service. I was quickly identified as a candidate for team lead within the 'integration' team, that is responsible for all developer operations, as well as packaging and shipping the product to market. On any given day I can be writing Typescript for one of our service API's, designing our distributed computing service on Kubernetes, or integrating our product into SCM, CI or any other service that makes sense.
