*Grasping the opportunity to join this impressive startup* spun out of Oxford University I joined as a Senior Developer right at beginning of the transition from prototype code to productionised service. Built on years of academic research DiffBlue aims to change the way developers test their code, and my role is to bring this to a straight forward, accessible service.
