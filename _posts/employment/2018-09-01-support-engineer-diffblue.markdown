*After offering help where possible and learning everything I could during my previous role* I was offered a role within the company's Support Engineering team, which was responsible for building and maintining internal tooling to support developers within the company, as well as analysing the performance of the technology regularly and feeding back this information to the core teams.

My time as a Support Engineer saw me become the sole maintainer of a large, customer-facing Python script designed to analyse any given java project for statistics about the source code and the bytecode.

I also built internal tools that analysed the output of the core technology for readbility and complexity; tools that were able to parse java source code and generate useful blocks of information to be consumed by the core technology to make analysis easier; and tools to crawl open source repositories on github and create work tickets based off of these repositories.

This role also included lots of work writing in Java, primarily refactoring Java unit tests, but also debugging and helping to resolve issues in Java components of the main product.

I was also afforded the opportunity to go on-site with customers to assist with installation, training, and support.
