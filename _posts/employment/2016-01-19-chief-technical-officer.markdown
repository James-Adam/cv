Bringing order to some of the technological chaos of this small but well regarded educational business. I have so far been responsible for securing and solidifying an existing product 'EasyRead', bringing it up to best practices and ensuring it is able to scale with continued success. Helping the existing development team mature, become more efficient in their coding practices and project management. Technically I have moved architecture to a completely containerised micro-service architecture, using Javascript as our primary language across the team - backends in Express with MongoDB and front ends in React.
