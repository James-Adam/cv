*I was offered an opportunity* to join a small polyglot team within Diffblue that was working on a series of prototype projects that would expand the usefulness of the core product. Notably, I was able to work on:
- A 'zero running stack', entirely serverless, cloud based product that allowed a user to invoke the core technology's test generation capability entirely through AWS services, with the main computation being invoked through multiple invocations of AWS Lambda.
- A pure Golang CLI tool that implemented this same cloud-based serverless technology.
- A distributed computing system based on a Go implementation of the Gossip protocol.

I was also lucky enough to be able to assist with creating some front-end components in React, and assist with the creation of the 'SaaS' infastructure in Terraform.
