*After the success* of bringing the enterprise product to market and arranging a regular release cycle with managable development, I went on to head the transition to a publicly accessbile SaaS product. This started with a 'sampler' product that would allow developers limited free access to our service. This required me to design and implement a completely 'serverless' backend - as the team was lean and not able to support 24/7-365. This was based on AWS Lambda and a number of other hosted services that avoided the need to have running architecture. At present I am scaling this up to accepting subscriptions and payments for a premium service - again with zero 'running' stack.
